      <p>My 10 year old son never quite took to solving the Rubik’s Cube - the online videos did not interest him. That changed after the first class with Kabir! He was hooked on and consistently (happily) trying the algorithms. In his words - “The pace was great! It was fast enough to keep it interesting yet, slow enough to understand!” Moreover, Kabir’s organization skills were amazing! There was a reminder email before class and a follow-up email after - with the recorded class videos & written algorithms on Google Slides.
This has been a very wise time investment for us :)

      <p>My daughter really enjoyed Kabir's classes and was always looking forward for his class.  She has absolutely no previous experience with Rubik's cube before. Now she can solve the 3x3 cube and most importantly has curiosity for solving other cubes. Kabir patiently explained step by step and also created youtube videos for the homework help. I was amazed how Kabir conducted the online class with 10+ kids by making sure every one is at the same phase for the next class. Who ever is stuck, he explained them on 1:1 basis, at the end of the class. He is so passionate about teaching and making sure they get the things right.

      <p>My son attended both Rubik's Cube and Java classes by Kabir this summer. I am really impressed by Kabir's organization and dedication in conducting these sessions - from planning curriculum, sending out detailed information over emails, to spending extra time beyond the classes to help the students get most out of it. My son already knew some of the basic Rubik's cube techniques, and Kabir spent extra time with him after the classes, allowing my son to learn some advanced tricks.  For Java, the first session started with installing Eclipse. After few classes, my son's laptop crashed, and Kabir again spent extra time helping him get started with Eclipse on another laptop. My son looked forward to attending both these classes every week - and didn't need reminders from me. That is a testimonial in itself to his teaching style :) Thanks a lot for your dedication Kabir, and introducing our son to the magic of speed-cubing, and fun with Java.

      <p>I had originally learnt to do only one side of Rubik's cube and lost interest since didnt have anyone to guide me. With your help and coaching I was able to regain interest and solve the whole Rubik's cube. I also learnt techniques to increase my speed.

Best part of the Java class was that you answered a lot of questions and helped everyone understand the concepts. I know once when I was behind you did a special 1-1 class for me to help me get back on track. Thanks for your help and I will be more confident learning Java further.
