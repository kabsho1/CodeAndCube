      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>Due to the coronavirus pandemic, schools have been closed down,
        resulting in young students staying at home with a lot of unstructured time
        on their hands; time is spent on playing video games and watching a lot of TV,
        while their parents are glued to their screens trying to work from home.
        To help in this situation, I plan to offer a few fun classes for younger kids.

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Kabir Batra and I am a rising senior at Homestead High School.
        Some of my favorite things to do are challenging myself to learn new things,
        reading dystopian fiction books, and writing some code!
        Besides my passion for Computer Science, Physics, and Math,
        I also play the trumpet as part of the Marching Band and Jazz Ensemble,
        and I conduct a Brass Ensemble.
